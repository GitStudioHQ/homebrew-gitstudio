# GitStudio Desktop — Homebrew cask.

# One line: Homebrew taps github.com/GitStudioHQ/homebrew-gitstudio by name,
# and the fully-qualified cask on the command line is the consent Homebrew
# requires for a third-party tap (Homebrew::Trust.explicitly_allowed?), so
# nobody has to learn `brew trust`.
#
# THIS file is the source of truth. Version and checksums are rewritten by
# .github/workflows/release-desktop.yml on every app-v* tag — the
# `finalize-release` job reads the real SHA256s off the uploaded assets — and
# the result is pushed to the tap repository. Do not hand-edit them; they will
# be overwritten.

  # 2.3.0 moved to Electron 41, which runs on macOS 12 Monterey or later; on
  # macOS 11 the app would install and then not open. Homebrew refuses up
  # front instead. (2.2.1 is the last release for macOS 11.) A bare version
  # means "this or later" — Homebrew 5.1.11+, which `depends_on :macos` needed
  # already — and the old ">= :monterey" string now prints a deprecation
  # warning on every install. Raise it with the Electron that drops the next
  # macOS, together with scripts/install.sh's MIN_MACOS and a `minimum-macos`
  # note in that release's notes (RELEASING.md).

  # The build is not signed with a Developer ID, and Homebrew quarantines every
  # download (the --no-quarantine escape hatch was removed in Homebrew 5). On
  # macOS 15 and later a quarantined ad-hoc-signed app does not get the
  # "unidentified developer" prompt — it gets "is damaged and can't be opened",
  # with no way through. Strip the attribute from what was just installed, which
  # is what a user would otherwise have to do by hand.
  #
  # -s matters: Homebrew tags the framework SYMLINKS themselves, and without -s
  # xattr follows each link and strips its target instead, leaving fourteen
  # tagged links inside Electron Framework.framework — enough for Gatekeeper to
  # keep calling the app damaged with every regular file clean.

  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      This build is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. The cask clears
      the quarantine attribute after installing, so it should open normally.
      If macOS still says the app is damaged, run this once:

        xattr -d -r -s com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GitStudio.app

      If it STILL says damaged, macOS is re-scanning that path because an
      earlier copy there was refused; a fresh path is not scanned:

        brew reinstall --cask --appdir=~/Applications gitstudio

      If you already had GitStudio in /Applications from a direct download,
      Homebrew will not overwrite it. Re-run with --force to take it over.

      Prefer the one-line installer, which also verifies the checksum and
      clears the flag:  curl -fsSL https://gitstudio.dev/install.sh | bash
